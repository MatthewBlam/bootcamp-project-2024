                        Yesterday was a pretty busy day for me. I woke up extra
                        early to get some last minute studying in for my quiz in
                        Calc III. Every week we have a partner quiz, and up
                        until now I've had pretty good partners, so I was
                        optimistic coming into this week's quiz.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we began, I asked my partner how he felt about the
                        content, but his response was that he didn't know how to
                        do anything. He then proceeded to watch me take the
                        entire quiz by myself. He didn't even have the decency
                        to pick up his pencil!!! He just stared at me, paper
                        blank. While other pairs were collaborating and helping
                        each other out, I was left to thug it out all by myself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, the quiz itself wasn't all too bad, although I
                        was the last person to finish since I was solo. Praying
                        I never get that partner again.
